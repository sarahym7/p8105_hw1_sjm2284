# Problem 1

Load the dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Display the dataset, load library (dplyr) to allow for pull function to
work,get the number of rows and columns, find the mean flipper length

``` r
library(dplyr)

summary (penguins)

penguins_rows = nrow(penguins)
penguins_column = ncol(penguins)
 
mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)
```

In the dataset we can find the species, island, bill length, bill depth,
flipper length, body mass, sex, and year. There are a total of 152
Adelie, 68 Chinstrap, and 124 Gentoo. There are also 165 females and 168
males. The size of the dataset is 344 and 8. The mean flipper length is
also `mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm))`.
