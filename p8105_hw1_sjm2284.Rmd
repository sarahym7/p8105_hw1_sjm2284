# Problem 1

Load the dataset

```{r download_data}

data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```


Display the dataset, load library (dplyr) to allow for pull function to work,get the number of rows and columns, find the mean flipper length

```{r penguins_dataset}
library(dplyr)

summary (penguins)

penguins_rows = nrow(penguins)
penguins_column = ncol(penguins)
 
mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)


     
```

In the dataset we can find the species, island, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and year. 
There are a total of 152 Adelie, 68 Chinstrap, and 124 Gentoo. There are also 165 females and 168 males. The 
size of the dataset is `r nrow(penguins)` and `r ncol(penguins)`. The mean flipper length is also `mean(pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm))`.
